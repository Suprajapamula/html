        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Common measures of statistical dispersion are the standard deviation, variance, range, interquartile range, absolute deviation, mean absolute difference and the distance standard deviation. Measures that assess spread in comparison to the typical size of data values include the coefficient of variation
                The Gini coefficient was originally developed to measure income inequality and is equivalent to one of the L-moments.</p>
            <p>A simple summary of a dataset is sometimes given by quoting particular order statistics as approximations to selected percentiles of a distribution. </p>
